# Wentao He

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate from the School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), advised by [Dr. Jianfeng Ren](https://research.nottingham.edu.cn/en/persons/jianfeng-ren) and [Prof. Ruibin Bai](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~znzbrbb/), with the scholarship by Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). I also receive intensive guidance by [Prof. Xudong Jiang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/exdjiang/default.htm) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU). I obtained the M.Sc. from Imperial College London, U.K., supervised by [Dr. Stamatia Giannarou](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/stamatia.giannarou), and the B.Sc. from UNNC. My research interests include but are not limited to:

* Computer vision: Visual reasoning, Analoginal reasoning
* Signal processing: Radar target detection
* Operation research: Optimization
